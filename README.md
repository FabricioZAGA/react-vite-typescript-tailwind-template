# React Vite TypeScript Tailwind Template

A template for kickstarting React projects with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

Make sure to have these dependencies installed before proceeding.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your machine:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-typescript-tailwind-template.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-vite-typescript-tailwind-template
```
3. Install the dependencies using Yarn:
